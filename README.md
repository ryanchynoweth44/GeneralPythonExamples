# GeneralPythonExamples
This repository contains example Python code for various patterns and functions. This acts as a note keeping repository as well as a decent reference for anyone who needs a simple walkthrough. 

## Examples

- Threading
    - Python does experience a global interpretter lock, meaning that only one workflow can execute at a time. However, there are specific tasks or applications that can benefit from the [thread python library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html). 

- Singleton Software Pattern
    - Often times in software we have objects that we share across different classes and functions. While we still need to intialize classes with these shared objects, it can become a nusiance to allows have to update values between the classes that share it's properties. A singleton pattern allows objects to share and broadcast updates to all classes that have an instance of the shared object.
