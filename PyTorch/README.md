# PyTorch Examples

In this directory I will maintain a set of PyTorch examples to highlight features of the package in basic applications. These features can easily be extended to handle much more complex modelling solutions.  

- [CustomDataLoaders](CustomDataLoaders/README.md)
    - An explaination on how to create your own custom dataset and use the data loader module for efficient data transformations and network training. I also give a brief overview of hdf5 files using the [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/) package. 

- [HelloWorld_LSTM](HelloWorld_LSTM/README.md)
    - An official PyTorch example for timeseries data. 

- [LSTMWithCustomDataset](LSTMWithCustomDataset/README.md)
    - Based off the HelloWorld_LSTM example from PyTorch, I create my own custom dataset and train an LSTM to predict the sine wave.  

- [Notes](Notes/README.md)
    - Various notes about PyTorch best practices or neural network trips for better performing networks.
