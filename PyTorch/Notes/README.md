# PyTorch Notes

This directory is dedicated as a note keeping repository for PyTorch and other neural network information. 

My notes will be gathered from the following sources and organized appropriately. 
- [PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)

Topics Covered:
- [Automatic Mixed Precision](./PyTorch/Notes/PyTorchDocs/AutoMixedPrecision.md)
    - A method to help train networks faster with the same amount of accuracy. It also can assist in avoiding exploding gradients. In addition, we discuss how this process can be used to increase batch size using gradient accumulation. 

- [AutoGrad Mechanics](./PyTorch/Notes/PyTorchDocs/AutoGradMechanics.md)

- [Introduction to Neural Networks](./PyTorch/Notes/Basics/IntroToNeuralNetworks.md)
